# RIT Optimal Gym Time Finder

This is a tool that collects data from Rochester Institute of Technology's[Facility Occupancy Tracker](https://recreation.rit.edu/facilityoccupancy) and aggregates the data for a period of time and finds the time where there is on average the least amount of people.

Nobody likes when the gym is crowded, so I made this so I don't have to wait 20 minutes for a squat rack!
